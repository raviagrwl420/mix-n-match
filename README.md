# Mix-n-match: A novel 3D model generator
We implemented a novel 3D model generator using a mix-n-match modelling approach as our Geometric Modelling in Computer Graphics project. The program takes a set of 3D models belonging to a category e.g. *chair models* (models are pre-segmented and labeled) as input and outputs newly generated 3D models for chairs.

## Instructions
* Run `make` to build the executable
* Run `./mixnmatch` to launch the program
* Select *Start Game* on the UI and open the `sample_files` directory

## Dependencies
* OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) 2.8.1
* GLUT-based C++ User Interface (GLUI) 2.36
* OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) library
* CGAL 4.11
* OpenCV 3.3.1
* LIBSVM
* OSMesa
* Boost
